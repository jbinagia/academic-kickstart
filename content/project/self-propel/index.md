Microorganisms must often navigate through biological fluids (e.g. biofilms) that are viscoelastic, meaning they behave both as a liquid and a solid. In this paper, we use computational fluid dynamics and theoretical analysis to design a model microswimmer that can be used in place of live organisms in experiments studying the effect of fluid elasticity on motility.

This work was featured in *Physics* as a Synopsis article ([How a Swirling Tail Helps Microbes Swim ](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v14/s61)) and was selected as an Editors' Suggestion in Physical Review Fluids.
