Historically, numerical simulations of swimming microorganisms have been done in 2D with simplified models owing to the difficulty of resolving the complex three-dimensional transient motion of these organisms. Here, we use the immersed boundary method to perform the first fully-resolved 3D simulations of microswimmers and importantly, we show that in viscoelastic fluids the predictions of 2D and 3D models can differ quite substantially.
