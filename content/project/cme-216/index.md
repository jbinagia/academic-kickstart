  caption = "Trajectories of a naive (orange) and smart particle (colored) that are trying to move upward in a complex flow field. While the naive particle simply always seeks to orient itself upward to move up against gravity, the smart particle learns a complex series of orientations (shown in the legend) that it should take in order to ascend much further."
