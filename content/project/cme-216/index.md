  caption = "Trajectories of a naive (orange) and smart particle (colored) that are trying to move upward in a complex flow field. While the naive particle simply always seeks to orient itself upward to move against gravity, the smart particle learns a complex series of orientations (shown in the legend) it should take that allow it to ascend much further."
