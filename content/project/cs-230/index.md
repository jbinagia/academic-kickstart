# summary = "Generating independent configurations sampled from the physical Boltzmann distribution is an extremely difficult task, owing to the incredibly small volume in configuration space that high probability states (e.g. the folded state of a protein) occupy. Consequently, classical sampling of such Boltzmann distributions relies on the use of either Monte Carlo (MC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to slowly propagate a valid initial configuration forward in time, which is a slow and computationally expensive process. We employ here a neural network based approach to generate statistically independent configurations of various physical models in hopes of improving sampling efficiency of such states. We first show that our trained Boltzmann generator model can quantitatively recreate an analytical solution for the free energy of a double-well potential/ We then proceed to apply our Boltzmann generator to a simple harmonic oscillator confined in a box, and show that the agreement between generated samples and the analytical result converges as training proceeds. We conclude our report with perspectives on ongoing and future work."
