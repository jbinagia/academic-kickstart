abstract = "A method for creating metal patterns. A metal oxide film metal film is deposited on a substrate in a reactor. After the metal oxide film metal film has been deposited, the desired metal regions metal oxide regions are formed on the metal oxide film metal film using a reduction oxidation reaction. A reducing oxidizing gas is fed into the reactor. Furthermore, a heat source, such as a thermal probe or a high intensity laser beam, is pulsed to heat and form metal regions metal oxide regions on the metal oxide film metal film within the metal's reduction oxidation window. In this manner, benefits over prior patterning techniques are achieved, including greater control and uniformity, reduced cost, less waste and potential for sub-5 nm features"
